# INN Hotels ‚Äì Booking Cancellation Prediction

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of hotel booking cancellations. The goal is to help hotel management proactively address guest behavior, reduce last-minute cancellations, and optimize room allocation and revenue.

##  Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict whether a hotel booking will be canceled based on guest and reservation data.
- **Dataset:** Includes features like booking lead time, room type, customer type, deposit type, and length of stay.
- **Models Applied:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier

---

## Techniques & Tools

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- SMOTE for class balancing
- Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)
- Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC-ROC
- Confusion Matrix & ROC Curve Visualization

---

## Key Insights

- Long lead time and missing deposit were strong indicators of cancellations.
- Random Forest achieved the best predictive performance.
- SMOTE improved classification of the minority class (non-canceled bookings).
- Provided data-driven recommendations to reduce overbooking and optimize marketing.
